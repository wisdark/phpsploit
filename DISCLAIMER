PhpSploit framework disclaimer
==============================

Written by nil0x42 (https://github.com/nil0x42)

Please note that this software is not made to help cyber criminals to keep
access on remote servers unlawfully.

The PhpSploit framework is first and foremost a proof of concept, designed to
raise awareness on modern remote control technologies over the http protocol.

It provides authenticated access feature (through $PASSKEY modifications),
allowing legitimate users and authorized penetration testers to do their job
without breaking human laws, or putting someone else's infrastructure at risk.

As i know, you are a good guy, so you shouldn't inject a PhpSploit backdoor
in a remote server without strict consent of it's legitimate owner, or he
might never detect it due to it's stealth.
